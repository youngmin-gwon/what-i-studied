## Highlights
if the hacker is a creator, we have to take inspiration into account.

---
What and how should not be kept too separate.

---
When a piece of code is being hacked by three or four different people, no one of whom really owns it, it will end up being like a common-room. It will tend to feel bleak and abandoned, and accumulate cruft.

---
Relentlessness wins because, in the aggregate, unseen details become visible.

---
The other thing that's different about the real world is that it's much larger. In a large enough pool, even the smallest minorities can achieve a critical mass if they clump together.

---
We need a language that lets us scribble and smudge and smear, not a language where you have to sit with a teacup of types balanced on your knee and make polite conversation with a strict old aunt of a compiler.

---
people outside some very demanding field don't realize the extent to which success depends on constant (though often unconscious) effort

---
Dutch

---
Why don't smart kids make themselves popular?

---
I've never liked the term "computer science." The main reason I don't like it is that there's no such thing

---
Opinions we consider harmless could have gotten you in big trouble.

---
express in front of a group of your peers

---
The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things to think about

---
Prices are determined by supply and demand, and there is just not as much demand for things that are fun to work on as there is for things that solve the mundane problems of individual customers. Acting in off-Broadway plays doesn't pay as well as wearing a gorilla suit in someone's booth at a trade show.

---
We often like to think of World War II as a triumph of freedom over totalitarianism. We conveniently forget that the Soviet Union was also one of the winners.

---
They'll be things you've already noticed but didn't let yourself think.

---
The only external test is time. Over time, beautiful things tend to thrive, and ugly things tend to get discarded.

---
Nerds aren't losers. They're just playing a different game, and a game much closer to the one played in the real world.

---
The trouble with keeping your thoughts secret, though, is that you lose the advantages of discussion.

---
 Though hackers generally look dull on the outside, the insides of their heads are surprisingly interesting places.

---
Programmers tend to be divided into tribes by the languages they use

---
Writers and painters don't suffer from math envy.

---
There is a conservation law at work here: if you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars' worth of pain.

---
Almost certainly, there is something wrong with you if you don't think things you don't dare say out loud.

---
Bullying was only part of the problem. Another problem, and possibly an even worse one, was that we never had anything real to work on. Humans like to work; in most of the world, your work is your identity.

---
Hackers need to understand the theory of computation about as much as painters need to understand paint chemistry

---
it means you have one kind of work you do for money, and another for love.

---
If you look at the work of a painter in chronological order, you'll find that each painting builds on things learned in previous ones.

---
They don't consciously dress to be popular. They dress to look good. But to who? To the other kids. Other kids' opinions become their definition of right, not just for clothes, but for almost everything they do, right down to the way they walk.

---
Moral fashions don't seem to be created the way ordinary fashions are.

---
You don't have to know physics to be a good pitcher. But I think it could give you an edge to understand the underlying principles.

---
danger of premature optimization.

---
Programs should be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.

---
t was years after high school before I could bring myself to read anything we'd been assigned then. And I lost more than books. I mistrusted words like "character" and "integrity" because they had been so debased by adults. As they were used then, these words all seemed to mean the same thing: obedience.

---
One thing we can learn, or at least confirm, from the example of painting is how to learn to hack. You learn to paint mostly by doing it. Ditto for hacking.

---
What I'm saying is that open source is probably the right model, because it has been independently confirmed by all the other makers.

---
Galileo

---
Adults can't avoid seeing that teenage kids are tormented. So why don't they do something about it? Because they blame it on puberty.

---
The popular kids learned to be popular, and to want to be popular, the same way the nerds learned to be smart, and to want to be smart: from their parents

---
this nightmare scenario happens without any conscious malice, merely because of the shape of the situation.

---
design war

---
We may imagine that we are a great deal smarter and more virtuous than past generations, but the more history you read, the less likely this seems.

---
tend to arise from different sources than fashions in clothing, the mechanism of their adoption seems much the same.

---
I think the answer to this problem, in the case of software, is a concept known to nearly all makers: the day job.

---
Another example we can take from painting is the way that paintings are created by gradual refinement.

---
The fact that hackers learn to hack by doing it is another sign of how different hacking is from the sciences. Scientists don't learn science by doing it

---
Lately hackerliness seems rather frowned upon.

---
looking at things from other people's point of view is practically the secret of success.

---
How can you see the wave, when you're the water? Always be questioning. That's the only defence. What can't you say? And why?

---
I've found that the best sources of ideas are not the other fields that have the word "computer" in their names, but the other fields inhabited by makers. Painting has been a much richer source of ideas than the theory of computation.

---
Life in this twisted world is stressful for the kids. And not just for the nerds. Like any war, it's damaging even to the winners.

---
There is no prize for getting the answer quickly.

---
So if you want to understand where we are, and where we're going, it will help if you understand what's going on inside the heads of hackers

---
But the people at either end, the hackers and the mathematicians, are not actually doing science.

---
The mediocrity of American public schools has worse consequences than just making kids unhappy for six years. It breeds a rebelliousness that actively drives kids away from the things they're supposed to be learning.

---
Conformist

---
real effects

---
Maybe it would be good for hackers to act more like painters, and regularly start over from scratch, instead of continuing to work for years on one project, and trying to incorporate all their later ideas as revisions.

---
So another way to figure out which of our taboos future generations will laugh at is to start with the labels.

---
The money in software is one instance of a more general trend, and that trend is the theme of this book. This is the Computer Age

---
Civil liberties make countries rich.

---
To do good work you need a brain that can go anywhere. And you especially need a brain that's in the habit of going where it's not supposed to.

---
What can't we say?

---
Because they don't think it's fitting that kids should use the whole language. We like children to seem innocent.

---
within the computer world, expert programmers refer to themselves as hackers

---
Empathy is probably the single most important difference between a good hacker and a great one.

---
But in at least some cases the reason the nerds don't fit in really is that everyone else is crazy

---
You need a good sense of design to judge good design. And there is no correlation, except possibly a negative one, between people's ability to recognize good design and their confidence that they can.

---
Good hackers develop a habit of questioning everything.

---
To launch a taboo, a group has to be poised halfway between weakness and power.

---
As far as I can tell, the concept of the hormone-crazed teenager is coeval with suburbia.

---
Nearly all makers have day jobs early in their careers.

---
While we're on the subject of static typing, identifying with the makers will save us from another problem that afflicts the sciences: math envy.

---
It was supposed to be the Space Age, or the Atomic Age. But those were just names invented by PR people. Computers have had far more effect on the form of our lives than space travel or nuclear technology

---
The border between architecture and engineering is not sharply defined, but it's there. It falls between what and how: architects decide what to do, and engineers figure out how to do it.

---
But I think the main reason other kids persecute nerds is that it's part of the mechanism of popularity. Popularity is only partially about individual attractiveness. It's much more about alliances. To become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things that bring you close to other popular people, and nothing brings people closer than a common enemy.

---
 Closed thoughts and an open face. Smile at everyone, and don't tell them what you're thinking.

---
Another way to figure out what we're getting wrong is to look at what used to be acceptable and is now unthinkable.

---
suicide

---
So one way to build great software is to start your own startup.

---
Moral fashions more often seem to be created deliberately. When there's something we can't say, it's often because some group doesn't want us to.

---
the statements that make people maddest are those they worry might be true.

---
an attempt to explain to the world at large what goes on in the world of computers

---
Teenage kids used to have a more active role in society. In pre-industrial times, they were all apprentices of one sort or another, whether in shops or on farms or even on warships. They weren't left to create their own societies. They were junior members of adult societies.

---
But I think that misfits and iconoclasts are also more likely to become hackers. The computer world is like an intellectual Wild West, where you can think anything you want, if you're willing to risk the consequences.

---
But that disobedience is a byproduct of the qualities that make them good programmers.

---
it should be easy to figure out what such labels are, simply by looking at what people call ideas they disagree with besides untrue.

---
there is a strong correlation between being smart and being a nerd, and an even stronger inverse correlation between being a nerd and being popular.

---
Likewise, in any social hierarchy, people unsure of their own position will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they think rank below. I've read that this is why poor whites in the United States are the group most hostile to blacks.

---
Especially if you hear yourself using them. It's not just the mob you need to learn to watch from a distance. You need to be able to watch your own thoughts from a distance.

---
For hundreds of years it has been part of the traditional education of painters to copy the works of the great masters, because copying forces you to look closely at the way a painting is made.

---
Public school teachers are in much the same position as prison wardens

---
Hackers

---
The place to fight design wars is in new markets, where no one has yet managed to establish any fortifications. That's where you can win big by taking the bold approach to design, and having the same people both design and implement the product.

---
If I remember correctly, the most popular kids don't persecute nerds; they don't need to stoop to such things. Most of the persecution comes from kids lower down, the nervous middle classes.

---
Intellectual curiosity was not one of the motives on the FBI's list.

---
By singling out and persecuting a nerd, a group of kids from higher in the hierarchy create bonds between themselves.

---
How can we find these too?Another approach is to follow that word, heresy.

---
Source code, too, should explain itself.

---
break the rules

---
Hackers are unruly.

---
So if intelligence in itself is not a factor in popularity, why are smart kids so consistently unpopular? The answer, I think, is that they don't really want to be popular

---
defeatist

---
Painting was not, in Leonardo's time, as cool as his work helped make it. How cool hacking turns out to be will depend on what we can do with this new medium.

---
You're asking for trouble if you try to decide what to do without understanding how to do it.

---
m.o.

---
I don't like the name "computer science."

---
One way to do this is to ratchet the debate up one level of abstraction.

---
To find them, keep track of opinions that get people in trouble, and start asking, could this be true?

---
It means that a programming language should, above all, be malleable

---
So while I admit that hacking doesn't seem as cool as painting now, we should remember that painting itself didn't seem as cool in its glory days as it does now.

---
Best of all, probably, is humor.

---
when painters worked together on a painting, they never worked on the same parts.

---
Partly because teenagers are still half children, and many children are just intrinsically cruel.

---
But, as in a secret society, nothing that happens within the building should be told to outsiders. The first rule of Fight Club is, you do not talk about Fight Club.

---
Another way to counterattack is with metaphor.

---
If it's any consolation to the nerds, it's nothing personal.

---
Mapmakers deliberately put slight mistakes in their maps so they can tell when someone copies them. If another map has the same mistake, that's very convincing evidence.Like every other era in history, our moral map almost certainly contains mistakes.

---
As the fashion becomes established they'll be joined by a second, much larger group, driven by fear.9 This second group adopt the fashion not because they want to stand out but because they are afraid of standing out.

---
A woman I know says that in high school she liked nerds, but was afraid to be seen talking to them because the other girls would make fun of her. Unpopularity is a communicable disease; kids too nice to pick on nerds will still ostracize them in self-defense.

---
And why do they so often work on developing new technology? Why are there so many startups selling new drugs or computer software, and none selling corn oil or laundry detergent?

---
what hackers and painters are trying to do is make good things.

---
So hackers start original, and get good, and scientists start good, and get original

---
the best policy is to make it plain that you don't agree with whatever zealotry is current in your time, but not to be too specific about what you disagree with.

---
fashion

---
Part of what software has to do is explain itself. So to write good software you have to understand how little users understand.

---
the essence of hacking

---
If I had only looked over at the other makers, the painters or the architects, I would have realized that there was a name for what I was doing: sketching. As far as I can tell, the way they taught me to program in college was all wrong. You should figure out programs as you're writing them, just as writers and painters and architects do.

---
This phrase began with musicians, who perform at night

---
The right tools can help us avoid this danger. A good programming language should, like oil paint, make it easy to change your mind.

---
So if you want to figure out what we can't say, look at the machinery of fashion and try to predict what it would make un-sayable.

---
Nerds serve two masters. They want to be popular, certainly, but they want even more to be smart.

---
the essence of American-ness

---
Odds are you just think whatever you're told.

---
One of the less publicized benefits of the open source movement is that it has made it easier to learn to program.

---
The way to create something beautiful is often to make subtle tweaks to something that already exists, or to combine existing ideas in a slightly new way.

---
programming languages. Why should you care about programming languages?

---
one wonders, do we tell them this stuff for their sake, or for ours?

---
A lot of the statements that got people in trouble seem harmless now. So it's likely that visitors from the future would agree with at least some of the statements that get people in trouble today

---
Whereas hackers, from the start, are doing original work

---
Civil liberties

---
ugly variable names

---
They don't actually hate you. They just need something to chase.

---
optimal plan, if you can manage it, is to have a few trusted friends you can speak openly to.

---
disobedience

---
badly indented

---
Was it right or wrong? Ideally, no one got far enough to ask that.

---
You can't do anything really well unless you love it, and if you love to hack you'll inevitably be working on projects of your own.

---
What else can painting teach us about hacking?

---
There are worse things than having people misunderstand your work. A worse danger is that you will yourself misunderstand your work.

---
The other way makers learn is from examples.

---
In both painting and hacking there are some tasks that are terrifyingly ambitious, and others that are comfortingly routine. It's a good idea to save some easy tasks for moments when you would otherwise stall.In hacking, this can literally mean saving up bugs.

---
The example of painting can teach us not only how to manage our own work, but how to work together

---
hack

---
Great software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion to beauty.

---
Lack of empathy is associated with intelligence, to the point that there is even something of a fashion for it in some places.

---
One way to tell how good people are at empathy is to watch them explain a technical matter to someone without a technical background.

---
designing web-based software is like designing a city rather than a building

---
hackers are obsessed with free speech

---
moral fashions

---
it's considered bad manners to say that one language is better than another.

---
Why do hackers care so much about free speech? Partly, I think, because innovation is so important in software, and innovation and heresy are practically the same thing.

---
The problem with most schools is, they have no purpose. But hierarchy there must be. And so the kids make one out of nothing.

---
the key to flexibility, I think, is to make the language very abstract

---
All those unseen details combine to produce something that's just stunning, like a thousand barely audible voices all singing in tune.

---
The right way to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sharply defined modules, each with a definite owner, and with interfaces between them that are as carefully designed and, if possible, as articulated as programming languages.

---
to look at how taboos are created

---
What groups are powerful but nervous, and what ideas would they like to suppress? What ideas were tarnished by association when they ended up on the losing side of a recent struggle? If a self-consciously cool person wanted to differentiate himself from preceding fashions (e.g. from his parents), which of their ideas would he tend to reject? What are conventional-minded people afraid of saying?

---
I'm suspicious of this theory that thirteen-year-old kids are intrinsically messed up. If it's physiological, it should be universal. Are Mongol nomads all nihilists at thirteen?

---
One way to find these ideas is simply to look at things people do say, and get in trouble for

---
Big companies want to decrease the standard deviation of design outcomes because they want to avoid disasters. But when you damp oscillations, you lose the high points as well as the low. This is not a problem for big companies, because they don't win by making great products. Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies.

---
In our own time, different societies have wildly varying ideas of what's ok and what isn't. So you can try diffing other cultures' ideas against ours as well.

---
A startup is a small company that takes on a hard technical problem.

---
Sometimes what the hackers do is called "software engineering," but this term is just as misleading

---
you have the hackers, who are trying to write interesting software, and for whom computers are just a medium of expression, as concrete is for architects or paint for painters.

---
In the sciences, especially, it's a great advantage to be able to question assumptions.

---
A good scientist, in other words, does not merely ignore conventional wisdom, but makes a special effort to break it. 

---
My hypothesis is that the side that's shocked is most likely to be the mistaken one

---
there is not much overlap between the kind of software that makes money and the kind that's interesting to write.

---
What hackers and painters have in common is that they're both makers.

---
I think hackers just have to resign themselves to having a large random component in their reputations.

---
And so hackers, like painters, must have empathy to do really great work.

---
I think the important thing about the real world is not that it's populated by adults, but that it's very large, and the things you do have real effects. That's what school, prison, and ladies-who-lunch all lack
