## Highlights
Microinteractions also fit well into our already crowded,
      overcomplicated, and fragmented lives.

---
A microinteraction is a
  contained product moment that revolves around a single use case—a tiny piece
  of functionality that only does one thing

---
The difference between a product
  you love and a product you tolerate is often the microinteractions you have
  with it

---
    trigger

---
    Controls—digital and/or physical—are the most important part of
    user-initiated triggers

---
Input methods are also drastically changing microinteractions

---
Are these small
  things? Yes. Could we have manually done all of this? Yes. But when the car
  does it for us, it provides a sense of delight in the car, a feeling of
  pride of ownership. Isn’t that what all product manufacturers should want
  for their customers?

---
  microinteraction can create all sorts of experiences—for good and bad. Some
  microinteractions can be frustrating, some dull and forgotten, while the
  best are engaging and clever.

---
Microinteractions on the other hand are simple,
    brief, and should be nearly effortless (see Figure 1-3).

---
“The
    button meant for the first time the result of the human motion could be
    completely different from the motion [it creates] itself.” Action became
    abstracted.

---
A beautifully crafted
    microinteraction gracefully handles four different parts

---
    this small thing is really worth doing, that it’ll
    make the product so much better.

---
Like many rules, it’s
  hidden, and it’s compounded by the fact that other than the tiny orange mark
  on the switch, there is no onscreen indicator that the ringer is off.

---
Another reason to pay attention to microinteractions is because
      they fit so well into our multiplatform existence.

---
If the microinteractions are poor, the main features, no matter
      how nicely done, are surrounded by pain and frustration. The design of
      your product is only as good as its smallest part.

---
    the details that delight. Products that we love show an attention to
    detail

---
great observational skills: watching people interact, watching
  yourself interact, identifying the pain points, identifying logical
  sequences, and then determining which things make sense to bring together.

---
This book is for anyone who cares about making better products,
    particularly digital products.

---
    many microinteractions begin with an understanding of user need: what the
    user wants to accomplish, when they want to do it, and how often.

---
    Features tend to be complex (multiuse case), time consuming, and
    cognitively engaging.

---
Small? Yes. Unimportant? Absolutely not!
  Microinteractions is about those critical details that
  make the difference between a friendly experience and traumatic anxiety.

---
Microinteractions are the functional, interactive details of a
  product, and details, as Charles Eames famously said,[2] aren’t just the details; they are the design. Details can make
  engaging with the product easier, more pleasurable—even if we don’t
  consciously remember them.

---
it is essential not to be blocked

---
Microinteractions differ from features in both their size and scope.

---
buttons, switches, keyboards, and
    mice, we also have touchscreens, sensors, voice, and gestural means of
    triggering microinteractions.

---
those microinteractions needed to control actions
    far more abstract than turning on a light. Just as one example, syncing
    data across devices is a conceptually abstract idea, for which there’s no
    readily available physical analog.

---
We use them unquestioningly now, and only
    really pay attention to them when someone designs a better way, or the
    technology changes and allows for or forces a new way of performing the
    microinteraction.

---
The combination of well-designed micro- and macro- (feature)
    interactions is a powerful one.

---
Are microinteractions details? Damn right: the magic is all in the
  details

---
Well-designed microinteractions can scale
      well across platforms and to millions of users

---
This book dissects microinteractions in order to help readers design
    their own.

---
Microinteractions are frequently the last parts of a product to be designed
      and developed, and as such they are often overlooked. But ignoring them
      is a mistake.

---
This chapter will teach you how to distinguish microinteractions from
  features, and gives a brief history of
  microinteractions.

---
Great microinteraction design requires understanding the people who
  use the product, what they are trying to accomplish, and the steps they need
  to take. It requires understanding the context of those interactions.

---
The second step to great microinteraction is the implementation. There
  are lots of design issues here: triggers, rules, feedback, loops, and
  modes

---
In competitive markets, microinteractions are even more important.
      When there is feature parity, it is the experience using the product
      that increases adoption and brand loyalty.

---
Yes, the big picture matters, but so too
  does the detailed picture.

---
Even though we’re surrounded by microinteractions every day, we
  don’t usually notice them until something goes horribly wrong

---
triggers need not be user-initiated. Increasingly, triggers are
    system-initiated—when the device or application itself detects that
    certain conditions have been met and begins a microinteraction. The
    triggering condition could be anything from detecting that a new email
    arrived, to the time of day, to the price of a particular stock, to the
    location of the user in the world.

---
    rules

---
Even more than with triggers, feedback is the place to express
    the personality of the product.

---
Signature Moments are those microinteractions that are product
    differentiators

---
The first is to think about them on a case-by-case basis

---
A Signature
    Moment will help create customer loyalty and recognition.

---
But there is a third way to think about microinteractions, and that
    is that most complex digital products, broken down, are made up of dozens,
    if not hundreds, of microinteractions.

---
Mies van der Rohe’s mantra of “less is more” should be the
    microinteraction designer’s mantra as well.

---
In short, treat every piece of functionality—the entire product—as a
    set of microinteractions.

---
A second way to think about microinteractions is to reduce more
    complex applications to individual products that are each built around one
    microinteraction

---
But the opposite proved
  to be the case. “Having quickly graspable bits of information made the
  transaction much faster than trying to save screens in the steps of the
  process.”

---
loops and
    modes

---
Anything you see, hear, or feel that helps
    you to understand the rules of the system is
    feedback, the third part of microinteractions.

---
There are three ways of incorporating microinteractions into
    products
