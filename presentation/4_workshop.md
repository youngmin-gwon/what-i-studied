## OS?

Linus Torvalds, the founder of LINUX, says,
> The thing about operating system is you are never gonna see it.
  Because nobody uses operating system. People uses program on their computer.
  The only mission in life of an operating system is to `help those programs run`.
  So, the operating system never does anything on its own. It is `only waiting
  for the programs to ask for certain resources` or certain files on the disk 
  or ask for the program to connect them to the outside world.
  And then, the operating system come steps in, make it easy to write program.

2019년 인터뷰에서 그가 말했다. 
“한 주, 한 주, 한 주, 그리고 유닉스가 만들어졌습니다.” 분명 이것이 진정한 소프트웨어 생산성이다.
