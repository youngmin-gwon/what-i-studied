# 6. Designing with Objects
## (General) Guidelines
- 1. Do the proper analysis
  - users and developers should learn the systems and determine the system requirements
- 2. Develop a statement of work that describes the system
  - the SOW must represent the complete system and be clear about how the system will look and feel
- 3. Gather the requirements from this statement of work
  - the cost of a requirement change in early stage is relatively small
  - requirements are the most important part of the system
  - requirements must be specific enough to represent the true nature of the user's need for the end product
- 4. Develop a prototype for the user interface
  - developer doesn't necessarily create business logic when building prototype
  - look and feel of the user interface is a major concern at this point
- 5. Identify the classes
  - Highlight all the nouns from the requirements
- 6. Determine the responsibilities of each class
  - Focus on data that the class must store and what operations the class must perform
- 7. Determine how the various classes interact with each other
  - Examine how the messages between classes apply
- 8. Create a high-level model that describes the system to be built
  - look and feel is a concern
## You can create both good and bad OO designs just as easily as you can create both good and bad non-OO designs
## Find a process that you and your organization feel comfortable with, stick to it, and keep refine it
## Object Wrapper
- wrapping non-portable(or native) code
- wrapping code written by someone else
- purpose:
to provide consistent interfaces for the programmers who are using the code
## Object-oriented and structured code are not mutually exclusive
- Object Oriented constructs:

encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, composition
- Structured constructs:

sequence, conditions, iterations
- OO wraps structured code
