# 8. Frameworks and Reuse: Designing with Interfaces and Abstract Classes
## Contract
- a binding way to enforce code to comply with rules
  - abstract class
  - interface
- it standardizes coding conventions
## Abstract class
- a class that contains one or more methods that do not have any implementation provided
- it can provide concrete methods
- The only methods that a subclass must implement are the ones that the superclass declares as abstract:

abstract methods are contracts
## Interface
- it provides only abstract methods to subclass
- you can theoretically add an interface to any class if the design makes sense
