# 1. The promise of good tests

## The value of having unit tests
- tests help us catch mistakes
- tests help us shape our design to actual use
- tests help us avoid unnecessary complexity
- the biggest value of tests lies not in the resulting test
   but in what we learn from writing it.
   - the Law of the Two Plateaus
      - The first plateau lies where writing more tests or better tests no longer
         yields additional value
      - The second plateau is further up the hill, where we uncover further payoffs from changing our mindset—thinking about tests and testing as a resource richer than a mere tool for verification
   - you need to harness a whole different kind of value from the tests you write—creative, design-oriented value rather than the kind of protective, verification-oriented value of tests protecting you from regression and defects

## The role of unit tests in productivity
- forces of influence
   - speed of test execution
   - trustworthiness of tests
   - readability of tests
   - reliability of tests

## Acts
- Treat your test code like you treat production code—refactoring it mercilessly
- Start using your tests as a design tool that informs and guides the design of your code toward its actual purpose and use

## "test -> code -> design" process
