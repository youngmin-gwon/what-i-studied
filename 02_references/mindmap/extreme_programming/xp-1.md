# 1. Software Development
## risks of software development
- Schedule slips
  - XP calls for short release cycles
  - XP calls for implementing the highest priority features first
- Project canceled
  - XP asks the customer to choose the smallest release that makes the most business sense, so there is less to go wrong before production
- System goes sour
  - XP creates and maintains a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure quality baseline
- Defect rate
  - XP test for both programmers and customers
- Business misunderstood
  - XP calls for the customer to be an integral part of the team
- Business changes
  - XP shortens the release cycle, so there is less change during the development of a single release
- False feature rich
  - XP insists that only the highest priority tasks are addressed
- Staff turnover
  - XP asks programmers to accept responsibility for estimating and completing their own work, gives them feedback about the actual time taken so their estimates can improve, and respects those estimates
  - XP encourages human contact among the team, reducing the loneliness
## Economics
- factors
  - cash flow in and out
  - interest rates
  - project mortality
- how to maximize the economic value of the project
  - spend less (difficult)
  - earn more (not topical, it is marketing and sales part)
  - spend later and earn sooner
  - increase the probability that the project will stay alive
- options to maximize the project value
  - option to abandon
  - option to switch
  - option to defer
  - option to grow
- strategy to maximize the project value
  - accurate and frequent feedback about progress
  - many opportunities to dramatically change the requirements
  - a smaller initial investment
  - the opportunity to go faster
## Four variables to control the project
- values customers and managers get to pick
  - cost
    - the most constrained variable
    - deeply related to the other variables
  - time
    - out of hands of PM, in the hands of the customer
  - quality
    - external quality
      - measured by the customer
    - internal quality
      - measured by the programmers
- resultant value the development team pick
  - **scope**
    - the most important variable to be aware of
    - the easiest variable to control if we see the requirement changes as an opportunity, not a problem
      - we would fix the date, quality, and cost by developing the most urgent features (changing scope)
## XP
- Basic principles
  - central
    - rapid feedback
    - assume simplicity
    - incremental change
    - quality work
  - less central
    - teach learning
    - small initial investment
    - play to win
    - concrete experiments
    - open, honest communication
    - work with people's instincts, not against them
    - accepted responsibility
    - local adaptation
    - travel light
    - honest measurement
- Four values
  - communication
    - XP aims to keep the right communications flowing by employing many practices such as
      - unit testing, pair programming, task estimation
    - supporting relationship with simplicity
  - simplicity
    - make it work today for simplicity, make it smart next time if refactoring is needed
    - thinking ahead is listening to the fear of exponential cost of change curve
    - supporting relationship with communication
  - feedback
    - the more feedback you have, the easier it is to communicate
    - feedback works at different time scales
      - minutes and days -> unit test
      - weeks and months -> functional test
  - courage
    - communication supports courage
    - unsatisfying test score gives us courage to fix the problem, not to go ahead anyway
  - respect
