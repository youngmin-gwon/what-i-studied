## Extreme Programming: major practices
### 6. Refactoring
- restructure system without changing the behavior
- improve communication
- simplify or add flexibility
- sometimes do more work than absolutely necessary to get a feature running
- backed by
  - collective ownership
    - you don't mind to making changes thanks to collective ownership
  - coding standard
    - you don't have to reformat before refactoring thanks to coding standard
  - pair programming
    - you have a courage to tackle a tough refactoring thanks to pair programming
  - simple design
    - the refactoring is easier thanks to simple design
  - testing
    - you are less likely to break something without knowing it thanks to testing
  - continuous integration
    - you know in a matter of hours when you break something at a distance thanks to continuous integration
  - 40-hour week
    - you have more courage and are less likely to make mistakes thanks to rest
### 7. Pair programming
- 2 programmers at 1 machine
- backed by
  - coding standard
    - reduce the picayune squabbles
  - 40-hour week
    - reduce chances of unprofitable discussion thanks to rest
  - testing
    - give a chance to align their understanding before tackling the implementation
  - metaphor
    - ground their decisions about naming and basic design
  - simple design
    - make the pair understand what is going on
### 8. Collective ownership
- anyone can change code anywhere at anytime
- backed by
  - continuous integration
    - chances of conflicts go down
  - testing
    - chances of breaking things accidentally go down
  - pair programming
    - less likely to break code
    - learn faster what they can profitably change
  - coding standard
    - you don't get into the dreaded curly braces
### 9. Continuous integration
- integrate and build the system many times a day, every time a task is completed
- it is obvious who should fix a test that fails
- backed by
  - testing
    - you can assure you don't break anything
  - pair programming
    - half as many streams of changes to integrate
  - refactoring
    - more smaller pieces, reducing the chance of conflicts
### 10. 40 hour week
- never work overtime a second week in a row
- backed by
  - the planning game
    - more valuable works to do
  - testing
    - reduces frequency of nasty surprises
### 11. On-site customer
- a real, live user to answer programmers' question
- backed by
  - testing
    - produce value for the project by writing functional tests
  - the planning game
    - produce value for the project by making small-scale priority and scope decisions for programmer
### 12. Coding standard
- follow code rules emphasizing communication through the code
- backed by
  - whole
    - the whole makes team members more likely to be members of a winning team
### 5. Testing
- programmer: unit test
- customer: feature test
- don't have to write a test for every single method, only production method that could possibly break
- backed by
  - simple design
    - writing tests is not difficult thanks to simple design
  - pair programming
    - your partner can back failing test cases you cannot come up with thanks to pair programming
  - on-site customer
    - the customer feels good about the system when they see all of their tests running
### 4. Simple design
- simple at any given moment
- remove complexity as it is discovered
- conditions
  - 1. run all tests
  - 2. no duplicated logic
  - 3. state every intention important
  - 4. fewest possible classes and methods
- backed by
  - refactoring
    - refactored code means making change was not a worry
  - metaphor
    - your are sure future design changes would tend to follow a convergent path thanks to a clear metaphor
  - pair programming
    - confident you are making a simple design, not stupid design thanks to your partner
### 3. Metaphor
- a simple shared story of how the whole system works
- replace much of what other people call "architecture"
- backed by
  - testing
    - testing gives concrete feedback
  - refactoring
    - refactoring is to refine your understanding of what the metaphor means in practice
### 2. Small releases
- a simple system -> production quickly
- then release new versions on a very short cycle
- should ship the whole feature, not half
- backed by
  - the planning game
    - the planning game helps you work on the most valuable stories, so even a small system had business values
  - continuous integration
    - the cost of packaging a release is minimal
  - testing
    - testing reduces the defect rate enough
  - simple design
    - sufficient for this release, not for all time
### 1. The planning game
- quickly determine the scope of the next release by combining business priorities and technical estimates
- the customer update the plan themselves, based on estimates provided by the programmers
- backed by
  - small releases
    - any mistakes in the plan would have a few weeks or months of impact at most
  - on-site customer
    - customer could spot potential changes and opportunities for improvement quickly
