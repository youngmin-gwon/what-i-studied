# Extreme Programming
## Why extreme?
- code review is good = pair programming
- testing is good = unit testing, functional testing
- simplicity is good = keep trying the system to be simple
- design is good = daily refactoring
- architecture is important = defining and refining architecture all the time(metaphor)
- integration testing is important = continuous integration
- short iterations are good = iterations really short - second and minutes and hours
## Promises to
- programmer
  - able to work on things that really matter, everyday
  - won't have to face scary situations alone
  - be able to do everything in their power to make their system successful
  - will make decisions they can make best, but won't make decisions they aren't best qualified to make
- customer
  - will get the most possible value out of every programming week
  - will be able to see concrete progress on goals they care abhout
  - will be able to change the direction of the project in the middle of development without incurring exorbitant cost
## An answer to question, "How would you program if you had enough time?"
- write tests
- restructure the system when you learn something
- talk a lot with fellow programmers and the customer
## A lightweight, efficient, low-risk, flexible, predictable, scientific, and fun way to develop software
## Distinction from other methodology
- early, concrete, and continuing feedback from short cycles
- incremental planning approach
- ability to flexibly schedule the implementation of functionality in the face of change of business needs
- automated tests by programmers and customers
- reliance on oral communication, tests, and source code to communication system structure and intent
- evolutionary design process
- practices that work with both the short-term instincts of programmers and the long-term interests of the project
## Use XP when requirements are vague or changing
## Paradigm
- like driving a car
  - driving is not about getting the car going in the right direction
  - driving is about constantly paying attention, making a little correction this way, a little correction that way
- “Stay aware. Adapt. Change.”
