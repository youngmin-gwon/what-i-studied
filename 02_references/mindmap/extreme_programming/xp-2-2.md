# Extreme Programming Strategy
## Management
- Principles to help us navigate
  - Accepted Responsibility
    - manager's job is to highlight what needs to be done, not to assign work
  - Quality Work
    - manager trusts members
  - Incremental Change
    - manager provides guidance all along, not a big policy manual at the beginning
  - Local Adaptation
    - manager needs to take the lead in adapting XP to local conditions
  - Travel Light
    - manager does not impose a lot of overhead - long all-hands meetings, lengthy status reports
  - Honest Mesurement
    - whatever metrics the manager gathers should be at realistic levels of accuracy
- manager's job
  - run the Planning Game
  - collect metrics
  - make sure the metrics are seen by those whose work is being mesured
  - occasionally intervene in situations that can't be resolved in a distributed way
- managing components
  - metrics
    - the medium of the metric is the Big Visible Chart, a prominent chart everybody can see
    - Don't have too many metrics
    - Be prepared to retire metrics that have served their purpose
      - if a metric gets close to 100%, replace it with another that starts comfortably down in the single digits
    - you cannot manage an XP project "by the numbers"
      - the numbers are a way of gently and noncoercively  communicating the need for change
  - coaching
    - the measure of a coach is how few technical decisions he or she makes
      - the job is to get everybody else making good decisions
    - jobs
      - Be available as a development partner
      - See long-term refactoring goals, and encourage small-scale refactoring to address parts of these goals
      - Help programmers with individual technical skills, like testing, formatting, and refactoring
      - Explain the process to upper-level managers
      - Acquire toys and food
        - you have an entirely different discussion with your team when you are chewing at the same time
  - tracking
    - Gather whatever metrics are being tracked at the moment and make sure the team is aware of what was actually measured
    - Experiment with how little measurement they can do and still be effective
    - Know the rules of the game cold and be prepared to enforce them even in emotional situations
  - intervention
    - the XP manager must be comfortable stepping in, making decisions and seeing the consequences through to the end
    - humility is the rule of the day for an intervention
    - manager's job is to point out the need for change, not to dictate what is to change and how
    - if a team member is not working out, a manager needs to ask them to leave
    - the final duty of manager is killing the project
## Facilities
- open workspace for communication, small space for privacy
- worthy of constant experimentation for the feedback value at work
## Planning
- purposes
  - bring the team together
  - decide on scope and priorities
  - estimate cost and schedule
  - give everyone involved confidence that the system can be done
  - provide a benchmark for feedback
- principles
  - Do only the planning you need for the next horizon
    - This doesn't mean that you cannot do long-range planning. - You can, not in great detail
  - Accepted responsibility
    - Responsibility can only be accepted, not given
    - there is no such thing as top-down planning in XP
  - The person responsible for implementing gets to estimate
  - Ignore dependencies between parts
  - Planning for priorities vs Planning for development
- The Planning Game
  - abstracts the planning to 2 participants - business, development
  - each participant respects each other
    - a set of rules to govern how the relationship is conducted
      - the goal
        - maximize the value of software produced by the team
      - the strategy
        - invest as little as possible to put the most valuable functionality into production as quickly as possible, but only in conjunction with the programming and design strategies designed to reduce risk
      - the pieces
        - write the story cards
      - the players
        - development
        - business
      - the moves
        - (cyclic) phases
          - business/develpment
            - 1. Exploration
              - business writes a story
              - development estimates a story how long the story take to implement
                - Ideal Engineering Time
              - business can split a story
                - if dev cannot estimate a whole story
                - if business realizes tat part of a story is more important than the rest
            - 2. Commitment
              - business sorts by value
              - development sorts by risk
              - development sets velocity
              - business chooses scope
            - 3. Steer
              - iteration
                - business picks one iteration worth of the most valuable stories to be implemented
              - recovery
                - if development realized it has overestimated its velocity, it can ask business what is the most valuable set of stories to retain
              - new story
                - if business realizes it needs a new story in the middle of the development of a release, it can write a story
                - development estimates the story, then business removes stories with equivalent estimate from the remaining plan and inserts the new story
              - reestimate
                - if development feels that the plan no longer provides an accurate map of development, it can reestimate all of the remaining stories and set velocity again
          - development(=iteration planning)

not necessary for small dev team
            - 1. Exploration
              - write a task
              - split a task/combine tasks
                - if it takes more than a few days, break it down into smaller tasks
            - 2. Commitment
              - accept a task
              - estimate a task
              - set load factors
                - percentage of time developer actually spend to code
                - low for newer team member or coach
                - should not be higher than 7 or 8 for anyone, or they won't spend enough time helping
              - balancing
                - overcommitted programmer must give up some tasks
                - if the whole team is overcommitted, they must find a way to get back on balance
            - 3. Steering
              - implement a task
              - record progress
                - every two or three days one member asks each programmer how long they have spent on each task and how may days they have left
              - recovery
                - help overcommitted programmer
                  - by reducing the scope of some tasks
                  - by asking the customer to reduce the scope of some stories
                  - by shedding nonessential tasks
                  - by getting more or better help
                  - by asking the customer to defer some stories to a later iteration
              - verify story
                - functional tests are run to verify that the story works
    - once the rules are in place and relationship is improving, you can modify rules and, eventually, abandon the rules
- Iteration Planning
## Development
- Continuous Integration
  - reduces development conflicts and creates a natural end to a development episode
  - constant refactoring lowers the chance that two pair of programmers will change the same class or method at the same time
  - provides a rhythm to development - learn/test/code/release
- Collective Ownership
  - complex code does not live very long
  - prevents complex code from entering the system in the first place
  - increases your feeling of personal power on a project
  - spreads knowledge of the system around the team
- Pair Programming
  - a dialog between two people trying to simultaneously program
  - pair programming is not a tutoring session
  - the pair notices that each of them has strengths and weakness
  - encourages communication
    - enhances the software development process
  - with your partner watching, chances are that even if you feel like blowing off one of XP practices, your partner won't
## Design
- all four values play into this strategy
  - communication
    - a complicated design is harder to communicate
  - simplicity
    - design strategy that produce simple designs, but the strategy itself should be simple
  - feedback
    - simple design is done quickly and gives feedback quickly
  - courage
    - by stopping after a little bit of design, you can be confident that when the time comes, you can add
- rules to follow values
  - Create a design strategy that results in a simple design
  - Quickly find a way to verify its quality
  - Feed back what we learn into the design
  - Crank the cycle time for this whole process down as short as possible
- the principles also work
  - small initial investment
    - smallest possible investment in design
  - assume simplicity
  - incremental change
  - travel light
    - no extra design
- rules
  - 1. start with a test, so we will know when we are done
  - 2. design and implement just enough to get that test running
  - 3. repeat
  - 4. if you ever see the chance to make the design simpler, do it
- simplest design
  - 1, the code must communicate everything you want to communicate
  - 2. the code must contain no duplicate code
  - 3. the system should have the fewest possible classes and methods
- you should never make a design decision today if you don't need it today in the perspective of cost
- picture for design is hard to keep updated
## Testing
- Tests must be isolated and automated
- who writes test?
  - Programmers write unit tests
  - Customers write functional tests
    - XP team usually have one dedicated tester to write, run, and maintain functional tests
- (sometimes) other tests for better help
  - Paralle test
  - Stress test
  - Monkey test
