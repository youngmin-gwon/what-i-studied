## 4. Comments
### are always failures
- we cannot find the way to express the contents in comments with code
- unintentionally lies when it is ill-maintained
### Explain yourself in code, not in comments
### (though) Good comments
- Legal Comments
- Informative Comments
- Explanation of Intent
- Clarification
  - when it is standard library or in code you cannot alter, it helps
    - (for dart programmer) what about extension?
- Warning of Cosequences
- TODO Comments
- Amplification
  - What is important in this code
- for Public APIs
### Bad Comments
- Except good comments
