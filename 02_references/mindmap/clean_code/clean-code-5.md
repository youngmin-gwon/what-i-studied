# 5. Formatting
## Your style and displine survives, even though your code does not
## Follow team's formatting rule
- But all developers in team should agree upon the formatting style
## Horizontal Formatting
- Openness and Density
  - use whitespace to accentuate like the precedence of operators
- Alignment
  - not useful. IDE will do
- Indentation
  - allow developers quickly hop over scopes, such as if/else
- Breaking Indentation
  - some doesn't like collapsing scopes down to one line
## Vertical Formatting
- Write code like newspaper article
  - simple, but explanatory name
  - high level concepts first, and supporting details later
  - most are very small
- Openness Between Concepts
  - blank line between package / import / each function
- Density
  - tightly related code appear vertically dense like member variables
- Distance
  - related concepts should be kept close
  - variables should be declared as close to their usage
  - instance variables should be declared at the top of the class
  - dependent functions should be vertically close, and the caller should be above the callee
  - the stronger that affinity, the less vertical distance there should be between them
- Ordering
  - a function called should be below a function calling
## Small chunk is better
