## Highlights
The most basic level of processing

---
Feedback must be immediate

---
The last question could have been answered factually, but is usually most easily answered by recalling the activities performed to open the door. This is called procedural memory

---
1.   Goal (form the goal)
       2.   Plan (the action)
       3.   Specify (an action sequence)
       4.   Perform (the action sequence)
       5.   Perceive (the state of the world)
       6.   Interpret (the perception)
       7.   Compare (the outcome with the goal)

---
This book covers everyday things, focusing on the interplay between technology and people to ensure that the products actually fulfill human needs while being understandable and usable

---
With complex devices, discoverability and understanding require the aid of manuals or personal instruction.

---
Conscious attention is necessary to learn most things, but after the initial learning, continued practice and study, sometimes for thousands of hours over a period of years, produces what psychologists call “overlearning,” Once skills have been overlearned, performance appears to be effortless, done automatically, with little or no awareness.

---
Why this deficiency? Because much of the design is done by engineers who are experts in technology but limited in their understanding of people.

---
Conceptual models are a form of story, resulting from our predisposition to find explanations.

---
One goal is to turn readers into great observers

---
THE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY THINGS

---
Natural mapping

---
For designers, the most critical aspect of the behavioral level is that every action is associated with an expectation.

---
Both conscious and subconscious modes of thought are powerful and essential aspects of human life. Both can provide insightful leaps and creative moments. And both are subject to errors, misconceptions, and failures.

---
Human-centered design is a design philosophy. It means starting with a good understanding of people and the needs that the design is intended to meet. This understanding comes about primarily through observation, for people themselves are often unaware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they are encountering. Getting the specification of the thing to be defined is one of the most difficult parts of the design, so much so that the HCD principle is to avoid specifying the problem as long as possible but instead to iterate upon repeated approximations. This is done through rapid tests of ideas, and after each test modifying the approach and the problem definition. The results can be products that truly meet the needs of people. Doing HCD within the rigid time, budget, and other constraints of industry can be a challenge

---
 One valuable explanation of the levels of processing within the brain, applicable to both cognitive and emotional processing, is to think of three different levels of processing, each quite different from the other, but all working together in concert.

---
The doors in the story illustrate what happens when discoverability fails

---
Visceral responses are fast and completely subconscious. They are sensitive only to the current state of things.

---
Subconscious thought is biased toward regularity and structure, and it is limited in formal power. It may not be capable of symbolic manipulation, of careful reasoning through a sequence of steps.

---
Interaction design

---
It is reflection that drives us to recommend a product, to recommend that others use it—or perhaps to avoid it.

---
The information in the feedback loop of evaluation confirms or disconfirms the expectations, resulting in satisfaction or relief, disappointment or frustration.

---
Conceptual models are often inferred from the device itself. Some models are passed on from person to person. Some come from manuals. Usually the device itself offers very little assistance, so the model is constructed by experience. Quite often these models are erroneous, and therefore lead to difficulties in using the device.

But she also had a second problem: she thought the problem lay in her own lack of ability: she blamed herself, falsely.

The term affordance refers to the relationship between a physical object and a person (or for that matter, any interacting agent, whether animal or human, or even machines and robots). An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used. A chair affords (“is for”) support and, therefore, affords sitting. Most chairs can also be carried by a single person (they afford lifting), but some can only be lifted by a strong person or by a team of people. If young or relatively weak people cannot lift a chair, then for these people, the chair does not have that affordance, it does not afford lifting

---
it is that everyone forms stories (conceptual models) to explain what they have observed. In the absence of external information, people can let their imagination run free as long as the conceptual models they develop account for the facts as they perceive them.

---
•  Do not blame people when they fail to use your products properly.
       •  Take people’s difficulties as signifiers of where the product can be improved.
       •  Eliminate all error messages from electronic or computer systems. Instead, provide help and guidance.
       •  Make it possible to correct problems directly from help and guidance messages. Allow people to continue with their task: Don’t impede progress—help make it smooth and continuous. Never make people start over.
       •  Assume that what people have done is partially correct, so if it is inappropriate, provide the guidance that allows them to correct the problem and be on their way.
       •  Think positively, for yourself and for the people you interact with.

---
It seems natural for people to blame their own misfortunes on the environment. It seems equally natural to blame other people’s misfortunes on their personalities. Just the opposite attribution, by the way, is made when things go well. When things go right, people credit their own abilities and intelligence. The onlookers do the reverse. When they see things go well for someone else, they sometimes credit the environment, or luck.

---
Evaluating what happened has three stages: first, perceiving what happened in the world; second, trying to make sense of it (interpreting it); and, finally, comparing what happened with what was wanted

---
The phenomenon called learned helplessness might help explain the self-blame. It refers to the situation in which people experience repeated failure at a task. As a result, they decide that the task cannot be done, at least not by them: they are helpless. They stop trying.

---
Suppose I try to use an everyday thing, but I can’t. Who is at fault: me or the thing? We are apt to blame ourselves, especially if others are able to use it.

---
How do we form an appropriate conceptual model for the devices we interact with? We cannot talk to the designer, so we rely upon whatever information is available to us: what the device looks like, what we know from using similar things in the past, what was told to us in the sales literature, by salespeople and advertisements, by articles we may have read, by the product website and instruction manuals. I call the combined information available to us the system image. When the system image is incoherent or inappropriate, as in the case of the refrigerator, then the user cannot easily use the device. If it is incomplete or contradictory, there will be trouble.

---
We attribute causes to events, and as long as these cause-and-effect pairings make sense, we accept them and use them for understanding future events.

---
Too much feedback can be even more annoying than too little

---
 Feedback is essential, but it has to be done correctly. Appropriately.
CONCEPTUAL MODELS

---
our goals

---
Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the other hand, screams out its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable.

---
Experience is critical, for it determines how fondly people remember their interactions. Was the overall experience positive, or was it frustrating and confusing? When our home technology behaves in an uninterpretable fashion we can become confused, frustrated, and even angry—all strong negative emotions. When there is understanding it can lead to a feeling of control, of mastery, and of satisfaction or even pride—all strong positive emotions. Cognition and emotion are tightly intertwined, which means that the designers must design with both in mind.

---
The earlier questions were memory for factual information, what is called declarative memory

---
except in a highly roundabout manner.

---
When we interact with a product, we need to figure out how to work it. This means discovering what it does, how it works, and what operations are possible: discoverability.

---
One important emotional state is the one that accompanies complete immersion into an activity

---
When the system computes the amount of time, it can compute the range of possible times. In that case it ought to display the range, or if only a single value is desirable, show the slowest, longest value. That way, the expectations are liable to be exceeded, leading to a happy result.

---
This false blame is especially ironic because the culprit here is usually the poor design of the technology, so blaming the environment (the technology) would be completely appropriate.

---
HCD is a philosophy and a set of procedures, whereas the others are areas of focus

---
Feedback has to be planned. All actions need to be confirmed, but in a manner that is unobtrusive. Feedback must also be prioritized, so that unimportant information is presented in an unobtrusive fashion, but important signals are presented in a way that does capture attention. When there are major emergencies, then even important signals have to be prioritized.

---
if the design team has representatives from all the constituencies present at the same time, it is often possible to reach satisfactory solutions for all the needs.

---
In the best of cases, the products should also be delightful and enjoyable, which means that not only must the requirements of engineering, manufacturing, and ergonomics be satisfied, but attention must be paid to the entire experience, which means the aesthetics of form and the quality of interaction

---
Because much human behavior is subconscious—that is, it occurs without conscious awareness—we often don’t know what we are about to do, say, or think until after we have done it. It’s as if we had two minds: the subconscious and the conscious, which don’t always talk to each other. Not what you have been taught? True, nonetheless. More and more evidence is accumulating that we use logic and reason after the fact, to justify our decisions to ourselves (to our conscious minds) and to others. Bizarre? Yes, but don’t protest: enjoy it.

---
The successful product has to satisfy all these requirements.

---
the relevant components must be visible, and they must communicate the correct message: What actions are possible? Where and how should they be done?

---
When people have trouble using technology, especially when they perceive (usually incorrectly) that nobody else is having the same problems, they tend to blame themselves. Worse, the more they have trouble, the more helpless they may feel, believing that they must be technically or mechanically inept.

---
The idea that a person is at fault when something goes wrong is deeply entrenched in society. That’s why we blame others and even ourselves. Unfortunately, the idea that a person is at fault is imbedded in the legal system. When major accidents occur, official courts of inquiry are set up to assess the blame. More and more often the blame is attributed to “human error.” The person involved can be fined, punished, or fired. Maybe training procedures are revised. The law rests comfortably.

---
FEEDBACK

---
The focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance people’s understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred.

---
Simplified models are valuable only as long as the assumptions that support them hold true

---
But designers should take special pains to make errors as cost-free as possible. Here is my credo about errors:
          Eliminate the term human error. Instead, talk about communication and interaction: what we call an error is usually bad communication or interaction.

---
creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer

the Gulf of Execution, where they try to figure out how it operates

---
Emotion and cognition are tightly intertwined.
DESIGN MUST TAKE PLACE AT ALL LEVELS: VISCERAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND REFLECTIVE
To the designer, reflection is perhaps the most important of the levels of processing.

---
He argued that the world contained the clues and that people simply picked them up through “direct perception.”

---
Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. We need both.

---
There are often multiple conceptual models of a product or device.

---
THE BEHAVIORAL LEVEL

---
The major areas of design relevant to this book are industrial design, interaction design, and experience design.

---
What information helps you understand how the thermostat works?

---
But what happens when things go wrong? How do we detect that they aren’t working, and then how do we know what to do?

---
In psychology, there has been a long debate about which happens first: emotion or cognition.

---
THE VISCERAL LEVEL

---
There are two parts to an action

---
Experience design

---
But the action cycle can also start from the bottom, triggered by some event in the world, in which case we call it either data-driven or event-driven behavior.

---
Great designers produce pleasurable experiences. Experience: note the word.

---
The behavioral level is the home of learned skills, triggered by situations that match the appropriate patterns. Actions and analyses at this level are largely subconscious.

---
visceral, behavioral, and reflective

---
The problem with the designs of most engineers is that they are too logical. We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be.

---
The challenge is to use the principles of human-centered design to produce positive results, products that enhance lives and add to our pleasure and enjoyment

---
Expectations play an important role in our emotional lives.

---
We also tend to believe that thought can be separated from emotion. This is also false. Cognition and emotion cannot be separated. Cognitive thoughts lead to emotions: emotions drive cognitive thoughts.

---
MAPPING

---
Emotion is highly underrated. In fact, the emotional system is a powerful information processing system that works in tandem with cognition

---
The seven stages provide a guideline for developing new products or services.

---
But when other operations were tried, such as my twisting and pulling, the filing cabinet provided no more information about whether I was getting closer to the goal.

---
“mental models.” Mental models, as the name implies, are the conceptual models in people’s minds that represent their understanding of how things work.

---
So the hierarchy of goals is roughly: satisfy hunger; eat; cook; read cookbook; get more light. This is called a root cause analysis: asking “Why?” until the ultimate, fundamental cause of the activity is reached.

---
A conceptual model is an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works. It doesn’t have to be complete or even accurate as long as it is useful.

---
both of these ideas can be correct.

---
How can such a simple thing as a door be so confusing? A door would seem to be about as simple a device as possible.

---
But in my experience, human error usually is a result of poor design: it should be called system error.

---
We need to remove the word failure from our vocabulary, replacing it instead with learning experience. To fail is to learn: we learn more from our failures than from our successes.

---
a starter kit for good design

---
Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology. When done well, the results are brilliant, pleasurable products. When done badly, the products are unusable, leading to great frustration and irritation. Or they might be usable, but force us to behave the way the product wishes rather than as we wish.
Machines, after all, are conceived, designed, and constructed by people. By human standards, machines are pretty limited. They do not maintain the same kind of rich history of experiences that people have in common with one another, experiences that enable us to interact with others because of this shared understanding. Instead, machines usually follow rather simple, rigid rules of behavior. If we get the rules wrong even slightly, the machine does what it is told, no matter how insensible and illogical. People are imaginative and creative, filled with common sense; that is, a lot of valuable knowledge built up over years of experience. But instead of capitalizing on these strengths, machines require us to be precise and accurate, things we are not very good at. Machines have no leeway or common sense. Moreover, many of the rules followed by a machine are known only by the machine and its designers.

---
when we reflect back upon the product, the reflective level might very well weigh the positive response strongly enough to overlook the severe behavioral difficulties (hence the phrase, “Attractive things work better”).

---
The reflective level is the home of conscious cognition. As a consequence, this is where deep understanding develops, where reasoning and conscious decision-making take place.

---
All three levels of processing work together to determine a person’s cognitive and emotional state.

---
People are innately disposed to look for causes of events, to form explanations and stories. That is one reason storytelling is such a persuasive medium.

---
one purpose of this book is to give back your control over the products in your life: to know how to select usable and understandable ones, to know how to fix those that aren’t so usable or understandable.

---
How can the designer help bridge the two gulfs? To answer that question, we need to delve more deeply into the psychology of human action. But the basic tools have already been discussed: We bridge the Gulf of Execution through the use of signifiers, constraints, mappings, and a conceptual model. We bridge the Gulf of Evaluation through the use of feedback and a conceptual model.

---
LEARNED HELPLESSNESS

---
There are three stages of execution that follow from the goal: plan, specify, and perform

---
Harvard Business School marketing professor Theodore Levitt once pointed out, “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!” Levitt’s example of the drill implying that the goal is really a hole is only partially correct, however. When people go to a store to buy a drill, that is not their real goal. But why would anyone want a quarter-inch hole? Clearly that is an intermediate goal. Perhaps they wanted to hang shelves on the wall. Levitt stopped too soon.

---
Behavioral states are learned.

---
The hard part is to convince people to understand the viewpoints of the others, to abandon their disciplinary viewpoint and to think of the design from the viewpoints of the person who buys the product and those who use it, often different people.

---
Here is where the style matters: appearances, whether sound or sight, touch or smell, drive the visceral response. This has nothing to do with how usable, effective, or understandable the product is. It is all about attraction or repulsion. Great designers use their aesthetic sensibilities to drive these visceral responses.

---
Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding. Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them? Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?

---
When we do this, we tend to attribute our behavior to the environment.

---
understanding

---
“You are being too logical,” I say. “You are designing for people the way you would like them to be, not for the way they really are.”

---
Reflection is cognitive, deep, and slow. It often occurs after the events have happened.

---
THE REFLECTIVE LEVEL

The system image is what can be perceived from the physical structure that has been built (including documentation, instructions, signifiers, and any information available from websites and help lines)
